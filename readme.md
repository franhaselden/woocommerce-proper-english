#Proper English for Woocommerce
###I like a good moan, so I made this version of woocommerce GB translation file that is, you know, actually in UK English

No more "coupons", instead we have "vouchers".

Can you believe that it was still written as "authorize"? It makes my blood boil.

No more "shipping", instead we have "postage" or "delivery", depending on context

Various other bits have been fixed up. Hopefully it's better. If you have any issues please raise them here or fork!
